Hello and Namaste, my fellow internet travelers. You've now landed on my blog.

Here, I just post my thoughts and advice in the hope that someone will read it and find it helpful. I never intended to write blogs or this sort of post, but after I recently completed my MCA (May 2024) during this recession period and have been applying for jobs, I felt compelled to share my journey.

Looking back, after my school days ended, I faced many challenges that turned me from a teenager into a man. Despite coming from a middle-class family and having to compromise on various things, I never lost hope and always looked forward. Thanks to my parents, who did more than enough for me, I was motivated to focus on my studies.

I took admission in BCA despite family problems and kept hustling, clearing it with good grades. My goal was to clear the NIMCET exam for MCA, and though I prepared seriously, I couldn't clear it. This was a tough time, but I persisted and took admission in Galgotias University for MCA with the help of an education loan.

After completing my MCA with good grades, I am still looking for placement after all the hustling, which can be disheartening. I've seen friends without degrees finding success, which made me realize that skills can be just as important, if not more so, than degrees. However, I still believe that education is crucial for survival in today's world.

I want to share my story not for sympathy or money, but to remind you all that there's no need for a degree if you have the right skills. Learn from mistakes, whether they are yours or someone elseâ€™s, and always keep pushing forward.

Happy Learning! :)
